# Champions of Regnum trainer

Since the famous regnumsentinel trainer is dead, all is left are operating
systems locked trainers, or the updated Inquisition trainer from the german
Regnum forum but it has some outdated mechanics.

This is a (simpler) knockoff of the regnumsentinel website trainer, this one will
be alive as long as GitHub exists and is free software.

It just requires a webserver to run.

**This is beta software, bugs may exist**

## Known issues

* the power database is a bit outdated, once bugs will be squashed i'll work on this. Or send PRs
  please.
* display on mobile devices is weird due to flex. it's not easy to fix, as
  even regnumsentinel had the issue. Use your device in landscape mode if it
  really bothers you
* shared urls are long, this could be fixed by using an url shortener api,
  but free plans may be quickly limit rated and they're not permanent. I don't want to have a
  database server, since it then would require a server and a domain, and could go down
  like regnumsentinel.
